# Problems with previous design

## Durability
- Base gets bendy
- Base becomes crunchy
- LED strips have peeled off the base
- Some of the LEDs have gone out

## Repairability
- The diffuser is hard to get off
- The base is hard to get off
- Cables aren't easy to unplug

## Visual
- Cable management has gone loose over time
- Color is inconsistent (probably the diffusers fault)
