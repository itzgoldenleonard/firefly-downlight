I suggest making a whole batch of them. I made a batch of 12 and here is the entire list of things that I used with quantities and price (excluding shipping). You will of course also need tools. The price could be lowered further by making bigger batches or by upcycling old materials that you have lying around or gotten for free/cheap. Obviously prices will vary depending on region, some of the things on the list also contain **way** more than you need, these are just the things that I bought and might not be the best option for you, but this should still be a helpful approximation.
